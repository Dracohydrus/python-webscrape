# Python Web Scraper using Selenium
<h3>GPU Availability Scanner</h3>
This is a very simple GPU Availabilty Scanner for NewEgg.ca & automated script using Selenium to check stock availability or automaticly purchase when available. It uses personal account information which is stored using Keyring. This script was originally made following a tutorial which I have refactored and enhanced for my own testing.

This script is intended for learning how to use Selenium in Python and how you can use it to WebScrape price data.

Since this script contains personal account information to log into your newegg account. I referenced the Keyring package which allows you to store that personal information and use the script with a bit more security. Follow the comments in the keyring_setup.py file to create your own personal keyring values for the script to work.

To change which URL is being referenced with both stock-check.py and newegg.py you will have to open the files and add the URL you prefer to use.
